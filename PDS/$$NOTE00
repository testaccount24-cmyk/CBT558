Note from Sam Golob:                (05-15-02)

   We are very grateful that Dick Thornton has gone over his files
   several times, before his retirement.  Each time, he has told me
   which members don't seem to make sense to him, and which ones
   he's deleting.

   I personally don't like to delete stuff from the tape, because
   somebody somewhere might find it useful.  So I'm making a place
   to tell you the members that Dick doesn't like, but that I'm not
   deleting, unless I see an overriding reason to do so.

   If a member doesn't seem to be complete, or doesn't seem to make
   sense, look in members $$NOTE2 or $$NOTE3 of this pds, to see if
   Dick wanted it deleted.  The fact that it still may be here, and
   it doesn't make sense, is due to my pack-ratness only!  Don't
   blame Dick for it.  He tried!

   Best of luck to Dick and to all of you.....

Sincerely,   Sam Golob     sbgolob@attglobal.net
