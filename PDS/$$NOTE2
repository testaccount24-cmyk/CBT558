Hi Sam,
I'm sending an XMIT unloaded PDS that contains updates (additions
and changes) to the ASM library, FILE558. In looking at the
existing FILE558, I think the $$README member probably would
replace both the $$NOTE1 and @FILE558 members, but you can decide
on that.

I have deleted the following members from my personal ASM PDS as
being useless and cluttering: ALIAS2, CHGDDNM0, CICSSCAN,
COB2MAIN, CURRDATE, DLITCBL, GETOWNER, IGGCSI00, IL10STRP,
INQ500FE, LISTPSWD, MODPSWD, TEST, UCB, UCBLKUP, VOLSPOLD,
VRNDUPDT, VTOCLISG, WTOEXP1, WTOHI, WTOLO, XPRNT, and XREAD.
These members are either incomplete, incorrect, missing macros
and/or called subroutines, duplicates, etc.

I mentioned incorporating the JCL library in the ASM file in my
last email.  However, since the JCL library contains JCL for both
the ASM and COBOL programs, sometimes both in one job, I guess it
is best left as you have it now in File 560.

Thanks,
Dick
