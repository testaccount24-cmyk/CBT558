*  THIS ROUTINE ACTS AS A FRONT-END BETWEEN IMS ONLINE AND THE COBOL  *
*  INQUIRY MPP. BY CALLING ILBOSTP0 (COBOL INITIALIZATION), THE MAIN  *
*  COBOL PROGRAM INQ500 IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS A "MAINLINE" PROGRAM,    *
*  SO THE COBOL CLEANUP, ILBOSTT0, IS NOT CALLED WHEN IT DOES ITS     *
*  "GOBACK." THIS PREVENTS ANY CLEANUP BEING DONE BETWEEN SCHEDULES.  *
*  THE CLEANUPS APPARENTLY FREE VSAM CONTROL BLOCKS THAT ARE NEEDED   *
*  DURING THE NEXT SCHEDULE OF THE PROGRAM. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT ONCE *
*  ANY ABEND OCCURRS IN THE INQ500 LOAD MODULE, THE ENTIRE REGION     *
*  MUST BE BROUGHT DOWN AND RESUBMITTED, OR EVERY RESTART ATTEMPT     *
*  WILL RESULT IN MSGIKF992I AND ABEND0C4 IN MODULE ILBOSRV.          *
*                                                                     *
