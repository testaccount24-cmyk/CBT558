Hi Sam,

Looks like I didn't test the RESOURCE program well enough. Mike
Hodapp (mike_hodapp@bat.com) found a bug. I have fixed it, and am
sending along a copy to you for replacement in FILE 558. If he is
beginning to test with it, he may encounter other errors, though,
so perhaps it may be a good idea to hold off updating it until we
have a chance to see if Mike finds anything else.

By the way, this is an unzipped binary transfer with no CR/LF
handling.

Dick
