Hi Sam,
I am sending an XMIT file of a PDS containing some documentation
files.  Although they are all named differently, each is intended
to be a $$README file for one of the CBT files:

    DATA is a new $$README for the DATA library included in FILE 564
    FILE558 is a replacement update for the $$README now in FILE 558.
    FILE564 is a new $$README for FILE 564.
    INSTRUCT is a new $$README for the INSTRUCT library in FILE 564
    MEMORY is a new $$README for the MEMORY library in FILE 564

As I went through FILE 564 documenting things, I added
cross-references in the FILE 558 $$README to the members in the
INSTRUCT and MEMORY files.

Next, and finally, I will be working at documenting FILE 565.

Thanks again for your help,

See ya,
Dick
