Hi Sam,

Here is a file of adds and changes to FILE 558 (assembler stuff). Also,
as usual, I deleted a number of 'trash' members that are of no value and
add clutter. They are:

$COMMAND ALIAS2 CHGDDNM0 CICSSCAN COB2MAIN CURRDATE DLITCBL
GETOWNER IGGCSI00 IL10STRP INQ500FE LISTPSWD MODPSWD TEST UCB UCBLKUP
VOLSPOLD VRNDUPDT VTOCLISG WTOEXP1 WTOHI WTOLO XPRNT XREAD
Have a good day,

Dick

Note from Sam Golob:

   Member $MACLIB containing many assembler macros, was shipped today
   from Dick Thornton, in the hope that some of the "incomplete"
   members previously mentioned, might become usable.  Also, the
   SMODE macro, and SVC source for IGC0024C (SVC 243) were also added.
